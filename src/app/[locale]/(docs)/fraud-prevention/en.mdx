# Fraud Prevention

We care deeply about protecting our users. Opsy takes every reasonable measure to keep your money and data safe — but your vigilance is just as important. Fraudsters use many tactics to trick people into sending them money. Knowing how to spot a scam can help prevent loss.

Only send money to people you know and trust.

Opsy is designed for secure transfers between trusted individuals and companies. Do not send money to strangers or anyone you haven’t verified.

You are responsible for verifying the recipient.

Before sending money, make sure the recipient’s identity is legitimate. This includes individuals, vendors, or businesses. Opsy is not liable for losses caused by fraudulent recipients, incorrect transfers, or issues with product delivery or service quality.

Fraudsters may use money transfer services to steal funds.

Always pause and consider: “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”

10 Tips to Help You Avoid Scams

1. Don’t rush.

    Scammers pressure you to act quickly. Real opportunities will still be there tomorrow.
    
2. Ask for written details.

    Always request physical documents about the offer, product, or organization — not just emails. Legitimate businesses will provide them. Fraudsters often avoid written communication to reduce traceability.

3. Don’t invest in things you don’t understand.

    If you’re unsure about a product or investment, walk away. Scammers target those unfamiliar with financial tools.

4. Verify companies independently.

    Contact the business directly, look for official registrations or licenses, and don’t rely solely on what they tell you.

5. Get a second opinion.

    Ask your accountant, banker, or lawyer to review any major financial proposal. Fraudsters don’t want you to consult others.

6. Watch out for “small deposits.”

    Scammers often ask for low initial payments — but they add up fast. Even $30 from 1,000 people means $30,000 stolen.

7. Check refund policies.

    Legit businesses provide written guarantees. Get confirmation before committing any money.

8. Be skeptical of testimonials.

    Fraudsters create fake reviews or use actors. If something feels rehearsed or unverifiable, it probably is.

9. Protect your personal data.

    Never share credit card or bank details over the phone unless you initiated the call and trust the company. Use secure payment platforms only.

10. Trust your instincts.

    If something feels off — stop. If the seller is pushy, vague, or evasive — stop. If your gut says no — stop.
