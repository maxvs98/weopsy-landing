4. The date of the incident
5. A clear description of the issue

Complaints are reviewed within 5 working days, in line with Opsy’s internal policy. If additional time is required to investigate the matter thoroughly, the Head of the relevant department will notify the Compliance Officer.

Opsy reserves the right to request additional information or evidence to support your claim. Such information should be provided without unreasonable delay.

You will be notified of the status of the investigation and informed of the expected timeline for a final decision. The final response will be provided no later than 35 calendar days from the date the initial complaint or the requested additional information was received.
