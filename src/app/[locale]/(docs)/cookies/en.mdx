This is our Cookie Policy. It explains what “cookies” are and how our site uses cookies and other tracking technologies to improve our site and to deliver a better, and more personalised, service. Our Cookie Policy applies to all users of www.weopsy.com and any other websites operated by Opsy. By using our site, you are consenting to our use of cookies.

1. ## What is a cookie?
    1. Cookies are small text files that are sent by a website to a web browser, and stored by the browser. This enables the website to identify and track the web browser. Cookies can, among other functions, enable a website to recognise a device each time it visits, remember user preferences and recommend content.
    2. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, but rather the computer used. However, some cookies will contain personal information such as a user name.
    3. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies on the site:
        1. Session cookies will be used to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser.
        2. Persistent cookies will be used to enable our website to recognise you when you visit. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.
    4. The site also employs cookies from third parties such as Google Analytics.

2. ## What sort of cookies are there?
    There are four general categories of cookies:

    1. **Strictly necessary cookies**

        These cookies are essential to the functioning of a site, enabling you to move around the site and allowing the site to provide the services that you ask for. For example, a strictly necessary cookie might be used to log into secure areas of a site or to recognise the region you are in, thereby allowing the site operator to tailor the site accordingly.

        Strictly necessary cookies do not gather any information that could be used for marketing purposes and they do not retain information beyond the end of your visit.

    2. **Analytical/performance cookies**

        These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website. They allow the site operator to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it. This helps the site operator to improve the way the website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

        
        All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore cannot be used to identify individual visitors. The information is only used to improve how a website works.

    3. **Functionality cookies**

        These cookies allow a website to remember choices that a user makes and provide enhanced, more personalised features. For example, such cookies enable you to stay signed into the website and recognise you when you arrive. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track browsing activity on other websites.

    4. **Targeting cookies**

        These cookies record users’ visits to a website, the pages they have visited and the links they have followed. They are also used to ensure that users are presented with adverts which are relevant to their interests, to limit the number of times a particular advert is displayed and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. The information is often shared with other organisations, such as advertisers.
